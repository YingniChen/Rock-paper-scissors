Program Description:<BR/>
The rule is that rock counter scissors, scissors counter paper, paper counter rock, if they play even, it’s a draw. Basically, there are only three result of the rock paper scissors which are user win, computer win and game draw. So base on these three states, create three function that let the computer judge which state it is. To get into the state, we can set three number like 0,1,2 to represent rock paper scissors and set the random integer variable from 0-2 as the computer side, then compared the data between user and computer. Record the result 3 times and show the winner who won twice.
